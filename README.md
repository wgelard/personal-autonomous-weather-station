# PAWS — Personal Autonomous Weather Station <img src="docs/assets/images/logo.svg" alt="PAWS logo" width="40" align="center"/>

> Low-powered ESP32 weather station — SD card logging, RTC timekeeping, phone-based data gateway, time-series database, online dashboard and weather forecasting.

A learning-oriented project covering the full stack: embedded firmware, solar power, asynchronous data pipeline, and machine learning on local sensor data.

> 🌻 *Yes, that's a sunflower. It watches the sun. This station watches the weather. Close enough.*

## Roadmap

| Phase | Name | Key addition | Status |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Prototype | Core FSM + SD logging | 🟡 In progress |
| 2 | Backend MVP | Odroid C4 + gateway + dashboard (no forecasting) | ⬜ Planned |
| 3 | Clean board | Plug-and-play connectors + new sensors | ⬜ Planned |
| 4 | Outdoor | Stevenson screen deployment | ⬜ Planned |
| 5 | Extended sensors | Rain gauge + wind | ⬜ Planned |
| 6 | Forecasting | RF watering + LSTM weather | ⬜ Planned |
| 7 | Solar + air quality | Autonomy + PM2.5 | ⬜ Planned |
| 8a | Wi-Fi push | Station uploads directly, no gateway | ⬜ Planned |
| 8b | Cellular push | GSM/LTE for remote deployments | ⬜ Planned |
